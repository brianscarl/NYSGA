# NYSGA
Contains files related to nysga-online.org website.
The NYSGA website contains all field trip guidebooks created by
NYS geologists since 1956. All trip routes are found in a single
KML file. I would like to display them all in a single map
using Leaflet, and include hyperlinks to the full detailed 
field trip guide and trip stops for each and every trip. <br>
